This test has been completed using HTMl, Bootsrap, Javascript and Jquery.
The layput was created using the Bootstrap framework as this is a quick way to get a demo up and running with responisve design.
HTML 5 input tags were used to gather the text and options inputs for the data.
Data for the type was done by taking the active bootstrap tab at the time that the submit button is clicked.
The input options vary depending on what tab is currently active.
If an input on the currently selected tab is not filled or has incorrect requirements upon the submit button being clicked then an alert message
is shown to the user and the data is not appended to the list.
Data is persisted using localstorage to keep an array of previosuly accepted inputs to hold onto and append back on ot the 
queue when the page is refreshed.
I am aware that data would normally be persisted on a database with get ot set ajax requests made to the backend to retrieve or add data.
However my professoinal knowledge and experience is on the front end in HTML, CSS and Javascript so local storage was
used as an example to show data being persisted and used upon page reloads.
