This test has been completed using HTMl5, Bootsrap, Javascript and Jquery.
The layput was created using the Bootstrap framework as this is a quick way to get a demo up and running with responisve design.
HTML 5 input tags were used to gather the text and options inputs for the data.
Data for the type was done by taking the active bootstrap tab at the time that the submit button is clicked.
Input validation was all done in javascript as there where multiple different cases for validation depending on the selected 
tab and input requirements.
The input options vary depending on what tab is currently active.
If an input on the currently selected tab is not filled or has incorrect requirements upon the submit button being clicked then an alert message
is shown to the user and the data is not appended to the list.
A regex was used to test against the firstname and lastanme inputs to ensure only letters have been entered.
Data is persisted using localstorage to keep an array of previosuly accepted inputs to hold onto and append back on to the 
queue when the page is refreshed.
I am aware that data would normally be persisted on a database with GET ot POST ajax requests made to the backend to retrieve or add data.
However my professoinal knowledge and experience is on the front end in HTML, CSS and Javascript so local storage was
used as an example to show data being persisted and used upon page reloads.
I am also aware that security measure such as SQL injection prevention would normally be included on the backend.
Having this combination of server side form security and client side input security is normally the way a typical form would be created.
